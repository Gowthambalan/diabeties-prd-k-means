 chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, especially the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves. 
 Diabetes can be divided into two categories, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
Patients with type 1 diabetes are normally younger, mostly less than 30 years old.

Type 2 diabetes occurs more commonly in middle-aged and elderly people, which is often associated with the occurrence of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, arteriosclerosis, and other diseases.
So, let’s begin the project on Diabetes Prediction Using K-Means.

K-Means clustering:
               Cluster is defined as groups of data points such that data points in a group will be similar or related to one another and different from the data points of another group. And the process is known as clustering.
               The goal of clustering is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabelled data. 
               Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning since it doesn’t require labeled data.

------------------------------------------------------------\

1. First, initialize the number of clusters, K (Elbow method is generally used in selecting the number of clusters )
2. Randomly select the k data points for centroid. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
3. Categorize each data items to its closest centroid and update the centroid coordinates calculating the average of items coordinates categorized in that group so far
4. Repeat the process for a number of iterations till successive iterations clusters data items into the same group.
